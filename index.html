        <p>The War of the Wall between Arat and Belhast is finally ended with Arat victorious. In Erabose, the shattered capital of Belhast, we meet Rasputain Belroune, the sole survivor of the once proud Belhast Ministry of Intelligence. Rasputain is the
            last of his kind, an inspector trained in deception, detection, and murder, who now works as an assassin for the Belhast resistance. Tonight Rasputain has a new target, and a strange one at that; he is not to poison an Aratrian noble, or a
            commander of distinction, but rather an elderly, hobbling drunk— a story teller who preposterously claims, above all things, to be the dead tyrant king of Arat, the young Veluze. After surreptitiously poisoning the old drunk, Rasputain agrees
            to be his audience for one final story— the tale of Veluze and his rise to power. But Rasputain soon finds that the old man’s saga cuts dangerously close to bitter reality, and may contain the truth of how his once mighty nation was destroyed
            through deceit and cunning. Who is this old man? What truths dangle within his web of lies? And why was Rasputain sent to kill him? Dive into this dark fantasy and find a tale of adventure, love lost and found, political intrigue, and, above
            all, bloody revenge.</p>
